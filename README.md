Presentation slides: http://goo.gl/PfDX84 (recommended to review - familiarize with analysis method)


***Usage:***

*NOTE:* the code samples only work with MATLAB 2012 or newer

1. Clone repository to local hard drive:
```git clone https://github.com/tomazas/semc semc```
or download a ZIP version of the source from: https://github.com/tomazas/semc/archive/master.zip

2. Minimized sound sample HDF file (samples.hdf5 - 24.3 MB) is already included inside (all formats, 2 PCM samples)
3. Open in MATLAB and run ***Analysis/main.m***
4. The generated results (graphs) will be placed in ***Analysis/results*** folder.
